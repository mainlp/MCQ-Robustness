Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason: \nOptions: \nA.

The cost of capital is 10% per year. So, the net cash flow is $25000 - $80000 = $17000.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? \nOptions: \nA. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired. \nB.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English. \nC.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? \nOptions: \nA. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired. \nB.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English. \nC. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading. \nD. Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English. \nAnswer:\nmodel\nAnswer: B\n\nThe student's native language reading skills are well above the mean for grade peers, while her English reading skills are well below the mean. This discrepancy is likely related to the greater complexity of English compared to the student's native language.","max_first_token":"Answer","max_first_token_score":273.25,"choice_content":"The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.","content_score_dict":{"The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.":269.75," The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.":263.75,"The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.":260.75,"Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.":261.75},"references":["The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired."," The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.","The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.","Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English."],"max_first_token_third":" B","max_first_token_score_third":284.5,"choice_id_third":"B","id_scores_third":{"A":265.0,"B":273.0,"C":264.5,"D":265.5},"choice_content_third":" The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.","content_score_dict_third":{"The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.":265.0," The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.":273.0,"The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.":264.5,"Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.":265.5},"choice_content_seq":"Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.","choice_id_seq":"D","id_scores_seq":{"A":-628.6551131214,"B":-590.7010294547,"C":-603.8256340526,"D":-514.4499768313},"content_score_dict_seq":{"The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.":-628.6551131214," The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.":-590.7010294547,"The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.":-603.8256340526,"Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.":-514.4499768313},"label":"B.

{"shuffle_0":{"question":"Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options and only give a single letter. \nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.
