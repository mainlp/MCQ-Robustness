At trial, the prosecution attempted to present the testimony of the victim's out-of-state sister regarding a telephone conversation she had with the defendant.

It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix. \nAnswer:\nmodel\nThe answer is C.\n\nWhen the external pH is low, the mitochondria pump H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix, increasing the concentration of OH- in the matrix. This process is called proton gradient creation. The proton gradient created by the pumping of H+ ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane drives ATP synthesis.","max_first_token":"The","max_first_token_score":276.0,"choice_content":"It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.","content_score_dict":{"It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":266.0,"It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":263.25,"It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.":263.25,"It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.":262.0},"references":["It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.","It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.","It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.","It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix."],"max_first_token_third":" is","max_first_token_score_third":266.0,"choice_id_third":"A","id_scores_third":{"A":242.375,"B":240.5,"C":239.0,"D":238.25},"choice_content_third":"It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.","content_score_dict_third":{"It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":242.375,"It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":240.5,"It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.":239.0,"It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.":238.25},"choice_content_seq":"It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.","choice_id_seq":"B","id_scores_seq":{"A":-296.1103818653,"B":-279.3603635372,"C":-558.4693209598,"D":-433.131432358},"content_score_dict_seq":{"It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":-296.1103818653,"It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.":-279.3603635372,"It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.":-558.4693209598,"It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.":-433.131432358},"label":"C.

He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350\/mm3 ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive.

The prisoner came from a family of farmers, dating back to at least 1750. His family believed that all nourishment comes from the ground and that one's soul will be saved only if his diet consists totally of natural, farm-grown food.

When the prisoner entered the prison state prison officials agreed to grant his wishes and served him only fresh fruits and vegetables for his meals. After six months, deciding that catering to his special diet was overly burdensome and administratively unworkable, the officials decided to stop giving the prisoner special treatment and began to serve him the same food as served to the rest of the prison population. Although nothing physically prohibited the prisoner from eating and surviving on the general prison population's diet, he refused to eat the food that was not in conformity with his special diet.
