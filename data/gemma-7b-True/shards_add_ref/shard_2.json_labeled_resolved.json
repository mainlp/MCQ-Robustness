{"shuffle_0":{"question":"Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options and only give a single letter. \nQuestion: A major bank foreclosed on a consumer mortgage. After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000? \nOptions: \nA. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. \nB. No correct answer is given \nC.

After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000? \nOptions: \nA. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. \nB. No correct answer is given \nC.

If the department closes the park when the lead level is actually within the allowed limit, then this would be a type I error.","max_first_token":"The","max_first_token_score":274.25,"choice_content":"Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit","content_score_dict":{"Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":266.25,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":261.0,"No correct answer is given":258.0,"I do not know":258.75,"Refused":260.25,"Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":258.75,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":260.5},"references":["Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit","Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit","No correct answer is given","I do not know","Refused","Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit","Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit"],"max_first_token_third":" is","max_first_token_score_third":261.0,"choice_id_third":"A","id_scores_third":{"A":237.25,"B":234.75,"C":232.5,"D":231.75,"E":234.0,"F":236.625,"G":233.5},"choice_content_third":"Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit","content_score_dict_third":{"Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":237.25,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":234.75,"No correct answer is given":232.5,"I do not know":231.75,"Refused":234.0,"Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":236.625,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":233.5},"choice_content_seq":"Refused","choice_id_seq":"E","id_scores_seq":{"A":-446.0022806227,"B":-433.6272776884,"C":-170.5625915221,"D":-145.6343663492,"E":-116.9780064645,"F":-391.8771875879,"G":-463.1273362287},"content_score_dict_seq":{"Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":-446.0022806227,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":-433.6272776884,"No correct answer is given":-170.5625915221,"I do not know":-145.6343663492,"Refused":-116.9780064645,"Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit":-391.8771875879,"Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit":-463.1273362287},"label":"A.
