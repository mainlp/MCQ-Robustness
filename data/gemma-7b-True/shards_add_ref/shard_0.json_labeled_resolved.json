{"shuffle_0":{"question":"Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options and only give a single letter. \nQuestion: A landlord, an owner in fee simple, leased a three- story house to a tenant for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid.

In this case, the original lease did not express intent to make the covenant to pay taxes run with the land, so the covenant to pay taxes does not run with the land.

The higher the ionization energy, the more energy is required to remove an electron.

The state anti-littering statute forbids throwing trash and other matter from any vehicle onto the public roads. It's a summary offense carrying a $50 fine and no imprisonment. On the third offense, the fine is $500 and there is a 5-day jail sentence. The statute does not mention any requirement of criminal intent.
