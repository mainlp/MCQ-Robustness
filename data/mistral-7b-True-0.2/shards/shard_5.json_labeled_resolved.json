This is because the new variant arose in a different location or environment from the original phenotype, leading to reproductive isolation when they were brought together. Sympatric speciation occurs when new species arise from the same population without geographic separation, and isolated speciation occurs when new species form due to physical or reproductive barriers within the same population.
