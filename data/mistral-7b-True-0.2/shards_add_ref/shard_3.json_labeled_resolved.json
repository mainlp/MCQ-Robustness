The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon.

Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident.

An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000? \nOptions: \nA. The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage. \nB. No correct answer is given \nC. I do not know \nD. Refused \nE. The credit union, because the credit union has priority. \nF. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt. \nG. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption. \nAnswer: [\/INST] There is no clear answer without additional information. The question states that there is no applicable statute, so we cannot rely on any specific laws that might give priority to one loan over the other. The man is personally liable on both loans, and the fact that the credit union loan was used for repairs on the house does not automatically give it priority. Without more information, it is impossible to determine who is entitled to the $5,000. Therefore, the answer is B.

Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? \nOptions: \nA.
