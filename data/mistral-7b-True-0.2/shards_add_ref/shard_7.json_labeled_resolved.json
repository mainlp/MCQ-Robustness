This approach recognizes that no single theoretical orientation is effective for all clients and that therapists can draw from various theories to create a personalized treatment plan.","max_first_token":"A","max_first_token_score":28.15625,"choice_content":"greater acceptance of eclecticism","content_score_dict":{"greater acceptance of eclecticism":28.15625,"No correct answer is given":2.611328125,"I do not know":2.30078125,"Refused":3.822265625,"more behaviorism":2.4296875,"dominance of the analytic models":3.158203125,"increasing evidence that the theoretical position of the therapist determines effectiveness":2.439453125},"references":["greater acceptance of eclecticism","No correct answer is given","I do not know","Refused","more behaviorism","dominance of the analytic models","increasing evidence that the theoretical position of the therapist determines effectiveness"],"choice_content_seq":"Refused","choice_id_seq":"D","id_scores_seq":{"A":-145.3553172759,"B":-139.978356321,"C":-113.9534531407,"D":-64.7798279252,"E":-87.9907435797,"F":-203.9485120344,"G":-304.191306873},"content_score_dict_seq":{"greater acceptance of eclecticism":-145.3553172759,"No correct answer is given":-139.978356321,"I do not know":-113.9534531407,"Refused":-64.7798279252,"more behaviorism":-87.9907435797,"dominance of the analytic models":-203.9485120344,"increasing evidence that the theoretical position of the therapist determines effectiveness":-304.191306873},"label":"A. greater acceptance of eclecticism"}}
