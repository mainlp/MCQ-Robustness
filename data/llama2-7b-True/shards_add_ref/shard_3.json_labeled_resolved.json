{"shuffle_0":{"question":"Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options and only give a single letter. \nQuestion: As a result of the increasing northward movement of the population from a nearby city, a town enacted a zoning ordinance restricting present and future land use in the town to single family dwellings, except in the downtown commercial shopping area, and except for a small area in which multifamily dwellings not over 40 feet in height were permitted. In addition, all new construction or exterior modifications of existing buildings required prior approval of an aesthetic control board. The zoning ordinance defined the term \"family\" in the context of single family dwellings to mean only one or more persons related by marriage, blood, or adoption, thereby excluding unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single residence unit. The enabling legislation contained the following provision:\"This enactment is necessary to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens. \"A town resident owns a single family residence with five bedrooms. Prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance, the resident leased the premises on a month-to-month basis to a boyfriend and girlfriend and three other male law students.

{"shuffle_0":{"question":"Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options and only give a single letter. \nQuestion: Police received a tip from a reliable informant that a man was dealing cocaine from his home. Officers then submitted to a magistrate an affidavit setting forth circumstances showing probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. The magistrate issued a search warrant for narcotics at the man's address. Police officers went to the man's home and rang the door bell. When no one answered, the police broke in and entered the dwelling. They searched the rooms on the first floor and found no incriminating evidence, then walked outside and noticed a separate entrance leading up to the second floor of the dwelling.
